== Compiling with Visual Studio 2019 ==

The project opens, compiles and runs successfully under Virual Studio 2019, as of Apr 25, 2020.

Requirements:
  QT Visual Studio Tools, available at: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheQtCompany.QtVisualStudioTools2019

Known issues:

  Issue 1. 
    *Sometimes* Visual Studio complains there is no reference to an object when user tries to build the project.  
    
  Solution 1: 
    For some reason opening ImagePlay/ImagePlay.vcxproj instead of the .sln file fixes the issue.  
    Please note that even if you open the .vcxproj project file, the whole solution gets loaded, so you can build&run the whole ImagePlay straightaway.
